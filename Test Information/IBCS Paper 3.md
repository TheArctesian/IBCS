This paper is based on a case study produced annually by the IB and available on the OCC.

A clean copy of the case study must be downloaded by the IB coordinator and issued to the students with their examination paper.

The purpose of the paper is to assess the studentâ€™s ability to demonstrate the following objectives in relation to the syllabus:
- Assessment objective 1 
	know and understand
- Assessment objective 2
	apply and use
- Assessment objective 3
	construct, analyse, evaluate and formulate

This paper consists of **four structured questions**, which assess the whole syllabus in an integrated way.

Students are required to answer all of the questions.

The questions are related to the scenario in the case study. In addition to the case study further stimulus material may be provided in the examination paper.

Questions 1, 2 and 3 may be subdivided. Question 4 will require the synthesis of information from a range of sources, including independent research and investigations beyond the case study, to develop an extended response to a specified issue.

The number of marks for each part will be given on the paper, and is linked to the command term used. This will indicate to students the depth of the response required.

The case study
The case study is a valuable teaching tool that can be used to integrate all aspects of the syllabus.

The computer science case study provides the stimulus material for the investigation of a scenario involving current developments and/or issues in computer science. The information obtained will prepare students and form the basis of the requirements for answering the questions in HL paper 3.

The case study is an opportunity to keep the course abreast of current technology by introducing new technical concepts or issues requiring a more in-depth investigation than that required in the rest of the course. 

Through their investigation of the case study, students should be able to:
- demonstrate an understanding of the computer science concepts fundamental to the system(s) in the case study (objective 1)
- demonstrate an understanding of how the system(s) in the case study work (objective 1)
- apply material from the course syllabus in the context of the case study (objective 2)
- explain how scenarios specified in the case study may be related to other similar local and global scenarios (objective 3)
- discuss the social impacts and ethical issues relevant to the case study (objective 3)
- explain technical issues relating to the case study (objective 3)
- evaluate information that may be gathered from local and global sources including field trips, interviews, primary and secondary research, invited guest speakers and online interviews (objective 3)
- evaluate, formulate or justify strategic solutions based on the synthesis of information from the case study itself, additional research and new stimulus material provided in the examination paper (objective 3).
