## Abstract data structures (23 hours)
This will be examined at the level of diagrams and pseudocode.

> [!Warning]
> Students should be able to describe the most common data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees) and the most common data processing operations on each of the basic data structures (addition, deletion and retrieval of data, traversal, searching for a given data, sorting of data into some order).
