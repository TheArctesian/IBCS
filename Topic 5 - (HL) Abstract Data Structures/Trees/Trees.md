> Binary trees will be examined at the level of diagrams and descriptions. Students are not expected to construct tree algorithms using pseudocode.

1. Describe how trees operate logically (both binary and non-binary).
2. Define the terms: parent, left-child, right-child, subtree, root and leaf.
3. State the result of inorder, postorder and preorder tree traversal.
4. Sketch binary trees.
