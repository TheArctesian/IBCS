| Lower Hardware Costs                                                    | Can Function without a strong network or connection signal     |
| Lower maintenance and administrative cost                               | Can be upgraded easily                                         |
| greater control                                                         | Fixing individual parts is simpler                             |
| **Disadvantages**                                                       | **Disadvantages**                                              |
| the connection from the clients to the central processor must be stable | costs more to have individual self-sustaining systems          |
|                                                                         | special software is most likely necessary                      |
|                                                                         | itâ€™s harder to keep many systems secure as opposed to only one |
